# bluelearn-hackathon

LIT is a platform that not only teaches you, but helps visualise the concepts that make you capable to think on real life problems. We understand how it feels getting lost in a web full of scattered information. At LIT, we believe in learning that is organised and catered to the needs of every student.
So here we are and we have organised for you all the useful resources at your single click. Not only this we have provided online IDEâ€™s on our website for hands-on practise.

We have Front-end, Back-end, Machine Learning and Cloud Computing tracks to meet your demands. Join our newsletter to receive updates for upcoming courses and latest technology news.
